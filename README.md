<p>
We propose <strong>RF-Solver</strong> to solve the rectified flow ODE with less error, thus enhancing both sampling quality and inversion-reconstruction accuracy for rectified-flow-based generative models. Furthermore, we propose <strong>RF-Edit</strong> to leverage the <strong>RF-Solver</strong> for image and video editing tasks. Our methods achieve impressive performance on various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image/video inversion, and image/video editing.

## üî• News
- [2024.11.11] The homepage of the project is avaible!
- [2024.11.08] Code for image editing is released!
- [2024.11.08] Paper released!

## üë®‚Äçüíª ToDo
- ‚òê Release the gradio demo
- ‚òê Release scripts to for more image editing cases
- ‚òê Release the code for video editing


## üìñ Method
### RF-Solver
<p>
<img src="assets/repo_figures/Picture2.jpg" width="1080px"/>
We derive the exact formulation of the solution for Rectified Flow ODE. The non-linear part in this solution is processed by Taylor Expansion. Through higher order expansion, the approximation error in the solution is significantly reduced, thus achieving impressive performance on both text-to-image sampling and image/video inversion.
</p>

### RF-Edit
<p>
<img src="assets/repo_figures/Picture3.jpg" width="1080px"/>
Based on RF-Solver, we further propose the RF-Edit for image and video editing. RF-Edit framework leverages the features from inversion in the denoising process, which enables high-quality editing while preserving the structual information of source image/video. RF-Edit contains two sub-modules, espectively for image editing and video editing.
</p>

## üî® Code
### Setup
The environment of our code is the same as FLUX, you can refer to the [official repo](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux/tree/main) of FLUX, or running the following command to construct the environment.
```
conda create --name RF-Solver-Edit python=3.10
conda activate RF-Solver-Edit
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

### Image Editing
We have provided several scripts to reproduce the results in the paper. The resolution of following images is 1360*768. We suggest to run the experiment on a single A100 GPU
<table class="center">
<tr>
  <td width=10% align="center">Source image</td>
  <td width=30% align="center"><img src="assets/repo_figures/examples/source/hiking.jpg" raw=true></td>
	<td width=30% align="center"><img src="assets/repo_figures/examples/source/horse.jpg" raw=true></td>
  <td width=30% align="center"><img src="assets/repo_figures/examples/source/boy.jpg" raw=true></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="10%" align="center">Editing Scripts</td>
  <td width="30%" align="center"><a href="src/boy.sh">+ hiking stick</a></td>
  <td width="30%" align="center"><a href="src/horse.sh">horse -> camel</a></td>
  <td width="30%" align="center"><a href="src/boy.sh">+ dog</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width=10% align="center">Edtied image</td>
  <td width=30% align="center"><img src="assets/repo_figures/examples/edit/hiking.jpg" raw=true></td>
	<td width=30% align="center"><img src="assets/repo_figures/examples/edit/horse.jpg" raw=true></td>
  <td width=30% align="center"><img src="assets/repo_figures/examples/edit/boy.jpg" raw=true></td>
</tr>

### Edit Your Own Image
You can run the following scripts to edit your own image. The ```--inject``` refers to the steps of feature sharing in RF-Edit, which is highly related to the performance of editing. We suggest to tune this hyper-parameter from 2 to 8, selecting the results with best visual quality.
```
python edit.py  --source_prompt [describe the content of your image or leaves it as null] \
                --target_prompt [describe your editing requirements] \
                --guidance 2 \
                --source_img_dir [the path of your source image] \
                --num_steps 30  \
                --inject [typically set to a number between 2 to 8] \
                --name 'flux-dev' --offload \
                --output_dir [output path] 
```
